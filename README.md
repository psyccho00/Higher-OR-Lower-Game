# Higher or Lower Game üéÆ

Welcome to the **Higher or Lower Game**, a fun and simple Python-based guessing game!

In this game, you'll be shown two popular people or entities with their descriptions. Your task is to guess **which one has more followers**. If you guess right, your score increases. If not, the game ends and your score is displayed.

---

## üìÅ Project Structure

This game is made up of three main files:

```
higher-or-lower-game/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ art.py          # ASCII art visuals
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ game_data.py    # Game data - names, follower counts, etc.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py         # Main game logic
```

---

## üß† How the Game Works

1. Two random "accounts" are shown.
2. You guess which one has more followers.
3. If you‚Äôre right, the game continues and your score increases.
4. If you're wrong, the game ends.

## üìù Code Breakdown

---

### `art.py` - üé® Game ASCII Art

This file contains fun ASCII art that‚Äôs printed during the game.

```python
logo = r"""
    __  ___       __             
   / / / (_)___ _/ /_  ___  _____
  / /_/ / / __ `/ __ \/ _ \/ ___/
 / __  / / /_/ / / / /  __/ /    
/_/ ///_/\__, /_/ /_/\___/_/     
   / /  /____/_      _____  _____
  / /   / __ \ | /| / / _ \/ ___/
 / /___/ /_/ / |/ |/ /  __/ /    
/_____/\____/|__/|__/\___/_/     
"""

vs = r"""
 _    __    
| |  / /____
| | / / ___/
| |/ (__  ) 
|___/____(_)
"""
```

- `logo`: Shows at the start and after every correct answer.
- `vs`: Displays between the two options for comparison.

### `game_data.py` - üìä Game Dataset

This file contains a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a public figure or platform.

```python
data = [
    {
        'name': 'Instagram',
        'follower_count': 346,
        'description': 'Social media platform',
        'country': 'United States'
    },
    {
        'name': 'Cristiano Ronaldo',
        'follower_count': 215,
        'description': 'Footballer',
        'country': 'Portugal'
    },
    ...
]
```

Each entry includes:

- `name`: Person or entity name.
- `follower_count`: Their follower count (used for comparing).
- `description`: What they‚Äôre known for.
- `country`: Where they‚Äôre from.

---

### `main.py` - üß© Main Game Logic

This file ties everything together. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

#### üì¶ Imports

```python
import random
from game_data import data
from art import logo, vs
from replit import clear
```

- `random`: To select random entries.
- `data`: The dataset with account info.
- `logo`, `vs`: ASCII visuals.
- `clear`: Clears the screen (works in Replit).

#### üîÅ Functions

```python
def get_random_account():
    return random.choice(data)
```

- Picks a random account from the dataset.

```python
def format_data(account):
    name = account["name"]
    description = account["description"]
    country = account["country"]
    return f"{name}, a {description}, from {country}"
```

- Formats the account info for display.

```python
def check_answer(guess, a_followers, b_followers):
    if a_followers > b_followers:
        return guess == "a"
    else:
        return guess == "b"
```

- Compares follower counts and checks if your guess was correct.

#### üïπ Game Loop

```python
score = 0
game_should_continue = True
account_a = get_random_account()
account_b = get_random_account()

while game_should_continue:
    account_a = account_b
    account_b = get_random_account()

    while account_a == account_b:
        account_b = get_random_account()

    print(logo)
    print(f"Compare A: {format_data(account_a)}.")
    print(vs)
    print(f"Against B: {format_data(account_b)}.")

    guess = input("Who has more followers? Type 'A' or 'B': ").lower()
    a_follower_count = account_a["follower_count"]
    b_follower_count = account_b["follower_count"]
    is_correct = check_answer(guess, a_follower_count, b_follower_count)

    clear()
    print(logo)
    if is_correct:
        score += 1
        print(f"You're right! Current score: {score}.")
    else:
        game_should_continue = False
        print(f"Sorry, that's wrong. Final score: {score}")
```
